                Ben Orlowski is a Denver transplant from West Plains, Missouri. Currently, he is enrolled in a programming bootcamp to start his journey to become a fullstack developer! <br>
                Coming from a background working with the juvenile at-risk population, after moving, he realized that becoming a developer is not just a dream, but can be a reality. <br><br>
                Since he was young, he has always been interested in technology and had to remain knowledgeable. Starting back with Windows 95, he has watched and evolved as technology evolved. From 3D printing and PCB design to home automation with HomeAssistant, Ben has worked diligently to remain on the cutting edge. <br><br>
                Currently, he has designed and implemented the following HIPAA compliant solutions: <br>
                <li>multiple security systems at medical facilities</li>
                <li>cat5 cables with custom lengths</li>
                <li>Implemented DNS server for group management in both government and private facilities. </li>
                <li>automated tasks within both government and private facilities.</li>
